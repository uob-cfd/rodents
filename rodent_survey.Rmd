# Introduction

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.

You know the drill now, but you can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert
Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

In this Notebook, we will ask you to "show" some values.  For example, imagine
you had already set a variable `a` to have the value 10:

```{r}
# Set a to have the value 10
a <- 10
```

To "show"" the value, you put the variable on a line on its own, like this:

```{r}
a
```

When you execute the chunk, the value appears after the chunk.


## Getting the survey data

This notebook analyzes some animal survey data.

The data is a processed version of a file from an Ecology data paper [Long-term
monitoring and experimental manipulation of a Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem near
Portal, Arizona, USA](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118).

I took a version of these data from a [short R
course](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson) by
<https://datacarpentry.org>, and processed the data further to select a subset
of the species from the original survey.  If you want to see what I did, have a
look at [the notebook I used to do the
processing](https://github.com/matthew-brett/biosciences-intro/blob/master/prepare_rodents.Rmd).

Run the chunk below to load my version of the data file.  If you unpacked the
exercise `.zip` file correctly, the file should be in the same directory as the
notebook.  If you get an error of form `cannot open the connection`, make sure
that the data file is in the same directory as the notebook.  If it is not,
check you are working on a copy of the notebook that you have unpacked from the
zip file and not the version opened directly from inside the zip file.  Please
ask for help quickly if you cannot solve the problem.

```{r}
# Load the data file as a data frame.
surveys <- read.csv("rodent_survey_18p2.csv")
# Show the first six rows
head(surveys)
```

After executing the chunk above, you should have a new variable called
`surveys`, of type ("class") *data frame*.

```{r}
# Run this chunk.
class(surveys)
```


## What's in the data frame?

Each row of the data frame corresponds to one rodent captured and measured for
the survey.  Each column corresponds to a different classification or
measurement for each animal.

Show the column names of the data frames with the following chunk:

```{r}
# Show the names of the columns
names(surveys)
```


Your chunk above should show the names in the first column of the table below.
The table also gives a description of what each variable means.

| Column             | Description                        |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| `record_id`        | Unique id for the observation      |
| `month`            | month of observation               |
| `day`              | day of observation                 |
| `year`             | year of observation                |
| `plot_id`          | ID of a particular plot            |
| `species_id`       | 2 letter code identifying species  |
| `sex`              | sex of animal ("M", "F")           |
| `hindfoot_length`  | length of the hindfoot in mm       |
| `weight`           | weight of the animal in grams      |
| `genus`            | genus of animal                    |
| `species`          | species of animal                  |
| `taxon`            | e.g. Rodent, Reptile, Bird, Rabbit |
| `plot_type`        | type of plot                       |


`plot_type` gives the type of the plot in which the animals were measured.
There were various types of plot, including control plots, with no restriction
on the rodents that could enter, and other plots, such as `krat exclosure`
plots, that excluded a particular type of rat. The "krat exclosure" kept out the
[banner-tailed kangaroo
rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner-tailed_kangaroo_rat).

The different plot types provide different environments.  For example, as you
will soon find, the banner-tailed kangaroo rats are particularly large.
Excluding these rats will change the competitive environment for other rats, and
this may change aspects of their health, such as their weight.

We will work up to an investigation of this question in the notebook.

Now your turn. Show the number of rows (animals) and columns (variables), using
the `dim` command:

```{r}
#- Use "dim" to show the number of rows, columns of the "surveys" data frame.
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 4 so far).
dim(...)
```


## Weight

We are interested to work out how the weight of the animals varies by various
factors, including species, sex and plot type.

Start by investigating the `weight` column of the data frame.  Use the
`summary` function to give a numerical summary of the values in the `weight`
column.  We just want a summary for the `weight` column, not the whole data
frame.

```{r}
#- Use "summary" to show a summary of the "weight" column of the data frame.
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 8 so far).
...
```

The summary gives us some idea of the distribution, but a histogram is even
better.   Plot a histogram of the `weight` column data.

```{r}
#- Plot a histogram of the values in the "weight" column.
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 13 so far).
...
```

The histogram does not look like a normal distribution.  It looks as though
there are different subgroups in these animals.  If we want to understand the
weight values, we need to see what these subgroups are.


## The difference between rodents

Your eye falls on the `species_id` column in the data frame.  This is a
two-letter code for the species of the animal.  What species do we have in this
dataset?

Use the `table` function to display a table of the counts for each value of
`species_id`:

```{r}
#- Use "table" to show the counts for each value of "species_id"
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 18 so far).
...
```

The different species will likely have very different weight distributions.

To investigate, we can start with a box plot.

We want a figure with a different box plot for every species, so we can see the
difference in the weight distributions.

Do to this we want a box plot of `weight` *as a function of* `species_id`.  If
you can't remember how to do this, check back on the [Datacamp
tutorial](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis).

Your box plot will have the different species on the x-axis, and the weights on
the y-axis.

```{r}
#- Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "species_id"
#- 8 marks / 100 (total 26 so far)
...
```

As we suspected, there is a big difference in species weights.  If your plot is
right, you should see that the species `DS` is much heavier than the other
rodents, on average.  This is *Dipodomys spectabilis*: the very same
[banner-tailed kangaroo
rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banner-tailed_kangaroo_rat) that we saw
excluded measurement plots.

At once this makes us wonder if the `DS` species was effectively excluded from
the `plot_type`s that were meant to exclude "Krats".  We will come back to that
question later.

## Narrowing the focus

It does not seem very useful for us to look at the weight for all rodents pooled
together, so we will restrict our attention to species `PB`. `PB` is Chaetodipus
Baileyi - [Bailey's pocket
mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey's_pocket_mouse).

Do do this, use the `subset` command to make a new data frame that only includes
the `PB` rodents. Check back at the tutorial for examples of how to select a
subset of a data frame that have a particular value in a column.

*Hint*: For your subset, you will have to compare the column values to some
text. For example, here are two comparisons of one bit of text against another:

```{r}
"PB" == "PB"
```

```{r}
"DS" == "PB"
```

```{r}
#- Use the "subset" function to make a new data frame called "pb_only" that
#- contains only the animals with "species_id" of "PB".
#- 8 marks / 100 (total 34 so far).
pb_only <- ...
# Display the first six rows of the new "pb_only" data frame.
head(pb_only)
```

Show the histogram of the weights from the new `pb_only` data frame.

```{r}
#- Plot a histogram of the "weight" column of "pb_only"
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 38 so far).
...
```

These weights should look a lot closer to a normal distribution than your
original histogram of weights from the rodents of all species combined.

Another factor that might affect weight is sex.

Display a table of the counts for the different values of `sex` in the `pb_only`
data frame:

```{r}
#- Display a table of the counts for each value of "sex" in "pb_only"
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 42 so far).
...
```

Show a box plot of the weights of the PB animals, as a function of sex:

```{r}
#- Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "sex" for the PB animals.
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 46 so far)
...
```

Your plot should show that female PB rodents weigh less on average than male PB
rodents.

In order to take this effect into account, one simple thing we can do is to use
`subset` again to make a new data frame that only has the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#- Make a new data frame called "pb_female" that contains only the female
#- animals from the "pb_only" data frame.
#- 8 marks / 100 (total 54 so far).
pb_female <- ...
# Display the first six rows of the new "pb_female" data frame.
head(pb_female)
```

Next we consider our question of interest, above, which is whether the different
type of plots in which the researchers measured the animals had an effect on
their weight.

The plot types are given in the `plot_type` column of the data frame.

First show a table of the counts for each value in the `plot_type` column of the
`pb_female` data frame:

```{r}
#- Display a table of the counts for each value of "plot_type" in "pb_female"
#- 3 marks / 100 (total 57 so far).
...
```

Do a box plot of `weight` as a function of `plot_type`, for the female PB
rodents.

```{r}
#- Show a box plot of "weight" as a function of "plot_type" for the female PB
#- animals.
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 61 so far)
...
```

At first blush, there does not seem to be a convincing relationship between
nutrition, as measured by weight, and the plot types.

One explanation for this unconvincing boxplot result is that plot types do not
influence nutrition of PB rats.

Another possibility is that the `weight` value is not a very good indicator of
nutrition.  Maybe we need to take the size of the animals into account, when
looking at their weight.   Well nourished animals may be heavy for their size.

The `hindfoot_length` column is one index of animal size.  We could try taking
this into account.

Start by looking at the relationship between `hindfoot_length` and `weight`.

Do a plot of `hindfoot_length` (on the x-axis) against `weight` (on the y-axis),
for the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#- Do a plot of "hindfoot_length" on the x axis against weight on the y axis,
#- for the female PB rodents.
#- 4 marks / 100 (total 65 so far)
...
```

We are going to try using `hindfoot_length` in a similar way to the use of
height in the well-known [body-mass
index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).

Make a new variable `rmi` - for Rodent Mass Index.  It will be the rodent weight
divided by the square of the rodent hindfoot length.

```{r}
#- Create a new variable "rmi" that has the "weight" values from the
#- "pb_female" data frame, divided by the squared "hindfoot_length" values.
#- 8 marks / 100 (total 73 so far)
rmi <- ...
# Show the first six values
head(rmi)
```

Show a histogram of the `rmi` values:

```{r}
#- Show a histogram of the values in `rmi`
#- 2 marks / 100 (total 75 so far)
...
```

Is this new `rmi` variable a better predictor of nutrition?  It's difficult to
know.  But we can ask whether it varies across the `plot_type`s more than the
raw `weight`.

Do a box plot of the `rmi` variable values as a function of the `plot_type`
values for the female PB rodents.

```{r}
#- Do a box plot of the "rmi" values as a function of the PB female plot
#- types.
#- 2 marks / 100 (total 77 so far)
...
```

Oops.  The relationship of `rmi` to `plot_type` still does not look completely
convincing.

Nevertheless, let us put the `rmi` values into the `pb_female` data frame, for
future reference.

```{r}
# Run this chunk
# Insert the "rmi" variable as a column in "pb_female".
pb_female$rmi <- rmi
# Show the first six rows
head(pb_female)
```

## More about the plot types

Thinking further, perhaps we have not got to the right data to answer our
question.  We are interested in the different plot types - but let us think
further about what we are interested in, exactly. For example, perhaps the key
thing for PB rat nutrition is the exclusion of the much larger DS rats.
Remember the DS rats are banner-tailed kangaroo rats, or "Krats" for short.

But - did the Krat exclosure plot types really exclude Krats?

To investigate this, we can look at the cross-tabulation of `species_id` with
the `plot_type` in which each rat was measured.  If the Krat exclosure plots
really excluded Krats, then we would expect there to be very few Krats measured
in the Krat exclosure types.  For this question, we need to return to the full
`surveys` data frame.

*Hint* - be careful to use to the `surveys` data frame, and not the `pb_female`
data frame you have been using for the last few chunks.

*Hint* - the rows of the table should refer to the plot types, and the columns
should refer to the species IDS.

```{r}
#- Create a "plot_type" by "species_id" table, store as "ptype_by_species"
#- 3 marks / 100 (total 80 so far)
ptype_by_species <- ...
# Show the table
ptype_by_species
```

The table suggests that "Long-term Krat Exclosure"s do a reasonable, but
imperfect job of excluding Krats, but it would be easier to look at this table
as percentages.  In particular, we would like to the percentage of Krats in each
plot type.  In the next chunk, calculate and show this percentage table.

*Hint 1*: investigate the `prop.table` function.  Have a look at the arguments
that you can send to this function.  Here you want the proportions / percents
within each row.

*Hint 2*: notice I've asked for your table in *percent* values (out of 100), not
*proportions* (out of 1).  You will probably find it easiest to calculate
proportions first, and then convert to percents.

```{r}
#- Calculate a table giving the percentage of Krats (species DM), and all the
#- other species, in each plot type.  The values should sum to 100 across each
#- row of your table.
#- Store your table as "ptype_by_species_pct".
#- 7 marks / 100 (total 87 so far)
ptype_by_species_pct <- ...
# Show the percent table
ptype_by_species_pct
```

Looking at the percent table, it seems that "Long-term Krat Exclosure" was the
only plot type that did a reasonable job of greatly reducing the percentage of
Krats.

Given that we are interested in the nutrition of PB rats in the absence of
Krats, we can restrict our analysis of female PB rat weights to the "Control"
and "Long-term Krat Exclosure" plot types.

Make a new data frame called `pb_female_ctl_krat` that has the rows from
`pb_female` for which the `plot_type` is *either* "Control" *or* "Long-term Krat
Exclosure".  Go back to the [Datacamp
tutorial](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis)
for a reminder of how to do this kind of subsetting.

```{r}
#- Make new data frame called "pb_female_ctl_krat" that has the rows from
#- "pb_female" for which "plot_type" is "Control" or "Long-term Krat
#- Exclosure".
#- 5 marks / 100 (total 92 so far)
...
pb_female_ctl_krat <- ...
# Show the first six rows.
head(pb_female_ctl_krat)
```

To confirm that you have only have plot types "Control" and "Long-term Krat
Exclosure" in your new data frame, and to remind yourself of what the
differences in `rmi` values were, do a boxplot of the `rmi` values of the
`pb_female_ctl_krat` data frame, as a function of the plot type.

*Hint* - if you have written the chunk above correctly your box plot below
should have two boxes, one for each of the two remaining plot types.  If you
don't have two boxes, go back and check the chunk above.

```{r}
#- Boxplot of "rmi" values from "pb_female_ctl_krat" as a function of
#- "plot_type"
#- 1 marks / 100 (total 93 so far)
...
```

The next question is designed to get you to do some independent work searching
the web and the documentation, to discover how to do something in R.

You have heard that R is an environment for statistics, and we now do our first
statistical test in R.

We want to do a t-test comparing the `rmi` values for the "Control" plot type
to the `rmi` values for the "Long-term Krat Exclosure" plot type.

In order to do this, use the `t.test` function in R. Investigate this function
in the RStudio help and online.  I suggest you use the "formula" method of
telling `t.test` what to look at.  In particular, you could ask `t.test` to show
you a t-test result for the `rmi` values from `pb_female_ctl_krat` *as a
function of* the `plot_type` from the same data frame.  You have probably
already been using this "formula" method for your boxplots.

When you have got this working correctly you should see output text starting
"Welch Two Sample t-test", and various results, including a t value of around
-3.7.

```{r}
#- Show the results of doing a t-test on the "rmi" values of
#- "pb_female_ctl_krat" as a function of the "plot_type" values from the same
#- data frame.
#- 7 marks / 100 (total 100 so far)
...
```

That's it.  Before you submit:

* Remember that you should submit the `.Rmd` file, not the `.nb.html` file,
  nor any of the other files that the R notebook makes.  Make sure your
  notebook file does have the extension `.Rmd`.
* Before you submit this notebook for marking, make sure that all the chunks
  execute correctly.  To do that, go to the Run button at the top of the
